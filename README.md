# ☕ Java Inheritance TV Project

This is a small Java practice project created while learning
Object-Oriented Programming concepts, specifically **Inheritance**.

The purpose of this repository is to keep learning exercises organized,
version-controlled, and accessible in one place instead of leaving them
unused on a local machine.

The project demonstrates a simple TV system with different channel types
inheriting from a common base class.

## Concepts Covered

- Java Classes and Objects
- Inheritance (`extends`)
- Method Overriding
- Basic Console Interaction

---

## Notes

This is a **learning and practice repository**, not a production-ready application.
The focus is on understanding core Java concepts rather than building a complete system.
