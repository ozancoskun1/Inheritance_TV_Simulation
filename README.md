# Inheritance_TV_Simulation
This project was developed to practice and demonstrate the **Inheritance** concept in Java as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  The project models a basic TV system where a `SmartTv` class extends a base `Television` class. It showcases parent–child class relationships, the use of the `extends` keyword, constructors, and method overriding
